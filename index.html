    <h4>MY THOUGHTS:</h4>
    <p>Coming from a family which is a blend of both conservative and liberal perpectives, I really do find manyof those "rules" monotonous and tacky. Although it's all done to "protect" us. Anyways I've always been curious of how science and technology and make the world effecient place to live.</p>
        and the list just goes on.
